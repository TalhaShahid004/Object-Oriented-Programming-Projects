# Object Oriented Programming Projects


</div>

This repository contains a collection of Java projects demonstrating various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It includes examples of classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation, providing practical applications of these principles.

## Features

-   **Library Management System:** A system showcasing how to manage books and users in a library, applying OOP principles.
-   **Pizza Factory:** Demonstrates the Factory design pattern, allowing for the creation of different types of pizzas.
-   **University Course System:** A system for managing courses, students, instructors, and grades in a university setting, implementing OOP principles.


## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TalhaShahid004/Object-Oriented-Programming-Projects.git
    cd Object-Oriented-Programming-Projects
    ```

## Running the Project

Each project within the repository is designed to be run independently. To run a specific project, navigate to its main folder and compile and execute the Java files:

**Example for Library Management System:**

1.  Navigate to the `Library-Management-System-OOP` directory:

    ```bash
    cd Library-Management-System-OOP
    ```

2.  Compile the Java files:

    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    ```

3.  Run the main class:

    ```bash
    java src/LibraryManagementSystemOOP
    ```

**Example for Pizza Factory:**

1.  Navigate to the `Pizza-Factory-OOP` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../Pizza-Factory-OOP
    ```
2.  Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    ```
3.  Run the main class:
    ```bash
    java src/Main
    ```

**Example for University Course System:**
1.  Navigate to the `University-Course-System-OOP` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../University-Course-System-OOP
    ```
2. Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    ```
3.  Run the main class:
    ```bash
    java src/Main
    ```

## Dependencies

-   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required to compile and run Java programs.
